# Snortelefier - Snort Telegram Notifier

Snortelefier is a simple Bash script designed to send Snort log alerts via a Telegram Bot. It monitors the Snort log file for any new alerts and sends notifications to the user's Telegram account. It's lightweight, fast, and customizable to meet your specific needs.

## Features

- **Real-time Snort log monitoring**: Uses `inotifywait` to track changes in Snort log files.
- **Telegram notifications**: Sends alerts to your Telegram account using a bot.
- **Rate limiting**: Control how often alerts are sent to avoid notification overload.
- **Easy to configure**: Simply set your Telegram bot token and chat ID in a `.env` file.
- **Systemd support**: Optionally add Snortelefier as a systemd service for automatic start on boot.
- **Security focused**: Restrict access to sensitive configuration files to the root user.

## How It Works

Snortelefier works by monitoring your Snort log file using `inotifywait` from the `inotify-tools` package. When the log file is updated (e.g., a new alert is triggered), the script sends the latest log entry as a Telegram message. To prevent spam, rate-limiting is applied based on user-defined thresholds.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of what a typical notification might look like:
```
